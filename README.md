> A plan for building up a IPMI card by RBPi (CM4 .etc) or other Linux cards. This kind of function were already been make into SoC by ASPEED into chip AST2400/AST2500 .etc, however DIY board might be cheaper.

### This proj is currently in background check stage

In Jeff Geerling (@geerlingguy)'s YouTube channel, he introduced a board like what I thought. `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVWF3u-y-Zg`

`https://github.com/Fmstrat/diy-ipmi` provide the IPMI software for RBPi.

**Other functions I want:**

- Integration MXM GPU slot on PCIe card.
